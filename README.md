# ⏰ RemindersBot – Telegram Reminder Bot

**RemindersBot** is my **first Telegram bot**, built as part of a **3-hour hands-on course** focused on learning
Telegram bot development through a real, production-style project.

This bot allows users to **create reminders directly inside Telegram**, stores them in a **PostgreSQL database**, and
runs **24/7 on Heroku**.

The goal of this project was to move beyond theory and understand how a real backend-powered bot works end to end.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Local Setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/remindersbot.git
cd remindersbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for security.

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=
DATABASE_URL=
```

## 📌 Project Overview

RemindersBot is a **Telegram Reminder Bot** that allows users to:

- Add reminders step by step
- Store reminders persistently in a database
- Receive reminders automatically after a specified time
- View upcoming reminders using commands

This project represents my **first complete Telegram bot**, from creation with **BotFather** to **cloud deployment**.

## 🎯 What I Learned From This Project

By building this bot, I learned how to:

- ✅ Create and configure a Telegram bot using **BotFather**
- ✅ Handle Telegram updates, commands, and messages
- ✅ Build state-based conversations (step-by-step user flows)
- ✅ Store user data safely using **PostgreSQL**
- ✅ Use **psycopg2** for database communication
- ✅ Design simple backend logic for reminders
- ✅ Schedule background jobs (delayed reminder delivery)
- ✅ Manage environment variables securely
- ✅ Deploy and run a Telegram bot on **Heroku**
- ✅ Keep a backend service running continuously (24/7)
- ✅ Structure a Python project for maintainability

This project helped me understand how **Telegram bots behave like backend services**, not just scripts.

## 🤖 Bot Features

- `/start` – Start the bot and show main menu
- Add reminder via interactive buttons
- Store reminders in PostgreSQL
- Automatic reminder delivery
- `/list` – View upcoming reminders
- `/cancel` – Cancel current action
- `/status` – View reminder statistics
- Graceful error handling and user state management

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Telegram Bot API**
- **BotFather**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Heroku**
- **psycopg2**
- **PyCharm**
- **Git & GitHub**

---

## ⚙️ How the Bot Works (High Level)

1. The user interacts with the bot in Telegram
2. The bot processes updates using `python-telegram-bot`
3. Conversation state is stored per user
4. Reminders are saved in PostgreSQL
5. Background jobs send reminders at the correct time
6. The bot runs continuously on Heroku

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The bot is deployed on **Heroku** and uses **Heroku Postgres** for data storage.

Deployment highlights:

- Environment variables for secrets (`BOT_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`)
- Worker-based execution
- Automatic restarts and monitoring
- Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database
